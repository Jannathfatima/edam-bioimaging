# EDAM-bioimaging

An ontology of bioimage informatics operations, types of data, data formats, and bioimaging topics


EDAM-bioimaging is an extension to the EDAM ontology (edamontology.org) for bioimage analysis, bioimage informatics, and bioimaging, developed in collaboration with partners from NEUBIAS Cost Action CA15124 (neubias.org) and EuroBioImaging PP2.

### Editing

At this momentary early stage of the development, the content of EDAM-bioimaging is developed collaboratively at http://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/2ce704bf-83ed-4d2e-985f-84c4841fac71/edit/Classes. After one dev cycle, these developments are commited in a batch to _git_. _Vice versa_, commits from _git_ are merged into WebProtégé.

**_N.B._:** Due to this special setup, edit either:
* in only _git_ or in only WebProtégé and merge afterwards
* or if needed in parallel, edit properties and root concepts only in _git_ and other concepts only in WebProtégé. Merge afterwards.

**_N.B._:** Be aware of how IDs of new concepts are assigned, and what it means for both **merging into _git_** and **[Comments](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#projects/2ce704bf-83ed-4d2e-985f-84c4841fac71/edit/Comments) in WebProtégé**.
